    <h2>Steve of Arabia: <span class="subtitle">Now that's the way to watch a world cup<span></h2>
    <img src="img/bbq.jpg" alt="An image of us wataching the world cup on a projector poolside with hookah." style="width:250px;height:300px;">
    <p>For the start of the world cup, a friend of mine suggested we all pull together to buy a projector so we can screen the world cup at my house. The Lebanese crew organised everything. They bought the projector, subscribed to Bein sport (the Arab equivalent of sky sports) and after work today,they came around and we set up by the pool.  We connected the satellite receiver to the projector and then hooked up the speakers. With the flick of a switch, there it was, bright, large and clear as crystal, we had picture.  But there was a problem. We had video but no sound. After 10 minutes of fiddling around, we got the sound working just in time for kick off. We had tons of crisps and tortilla chips with an amazing dip made by a friend of mine. Unanimously it was the best dip we all have ever had. We had a BBQ going. There was burgers, steak and all the juice you can drink. At kick off, some of us sat with our toes in the pool while others took a dip. This is the way football should be watched!</p>
    <h2>Training in Thailand: <span class="subtitle">The Arrival Part 1<span></h2>
    <p>After only an hours drive, I was already at Bahrain airport. This is journey which usually takes 2-3 hours due the monstrous traffic on the King Fahad causeway. Last night however there was barely a car in sight. It must be because it is Ramadan. Now a 3 hour wait till my flight. This is my least favorite aspect of traveling. I kept myself entertained watching the luggage wrap guy do his work. He seemed to be having fun. At one point he unsuccessfully tried to join 2 different sized and shaped bags together. The flight was uneventful.  First a 45 minutes to Abu Dhabi, 3 hour wait then the connecting 7 hour 40 minutes flight to Phuket. Out the window of the plane was a lovely view of some islands as we edged closer to Phuket. The customs officer wasn’t sure where Phuket Top Team was when he checked my immigration card. I had assumed they would know so I hadn’t written the address down on the card. I told him it was a muay thai gym and excitedly responded with “you muay thai? Good, good!” He took a photo of me for the system, stamped my passport and returned it to me with a huge smile. After claiming my luggage, I went to the cashpoint to redraw some money. Surprisingly a transaction failed due to insufficient funds message popped up on the screen. How could that be? I had transferred a large sum on to the card just a month earlier in preparation for this trip. What do I do now? Eat, Learn, Fight</p>
    <h2>Training in Thailand: <span class="subtitle">The Arrival Part 2<span></h2>
    <p>Luckily I had my Chinese bank card with me which had just enough on it to pay for a taxi from the airport to Phuket Top Team in Chalong. I opted for the private limousine as there a very long queue for the normal taxis. It cost 800THB.</p>
    <h4>You look like Raheem Sterling</h4>
    <p>The ride from the airport involved the usual conversations you have with cab drivers when you are in a foreign country. You know the one; where are you from? How old  are you? How long are staying for? Etc. The cabbie was a massive football fan. According to him, the English Premier league is very popular in Thailand. He was a Liverpool FC fan and said I looked like Raheem Sterling.  For non-football fans, Sterling is one of the hottest properties in world football at moment.  I personally don’t see the resemblance but hey, I’ve been told I looked like some famous black person everywhere I have been.</p>
    <h4>This is fighter street</h4>
    <p>It started raining quite heavily as we drove towards Chalong. The cabbie said in his broken English that it is raining season but the rain will stop soon. Start rain, stop rain, every time. Start stop start stop. We exited the main road on to a narrow lane and were immediately greeted with signs for Tiger muaythai, Chokchai muaythai, Phuket Top Team, Dragon muaythai, etc. The entire street is filled with fitness gyms, fight gear shops, protein and juice bars and restaurants. Situated at the top of this lane soi tai-ed, on the left handside is Phuket Top Team. I was greeted at the reception which also doubles as a fight gear shop by the general manager Mrs Khan. Her wide, welcoming smile immediately put me at ease. I checked in, had my passport photocopied and was given a Top Team card which allows me to train at the gym.</p>
    <h4>You wanna watch Muay Thai?</h4>
    <p>I got talking to lads waiting at the reception.  A Kiwi training muaythai and a Brit training BJJ. They, some of the trainers and Mrs Khan were going to watch some fights and asked if I wanted to join them. I explained the mishap with my card at the airport.  Mrs Khan must have overhead us because a few minutes later she not only gave me a ticket for the fights but also some money to tie me over until my bank is sorted out.</p>
    <h4>Nice Digs</h4>
    <p>One of the trainers, Nampon drove me to my accommodation about a minute away. The room is a good size with unsuite bathroom, double bed, flat screen TV, fridge, a desk and wifi. I dropped my luggage in my room and it was off to the fight we went. Eat, Learn, Fight</p>
